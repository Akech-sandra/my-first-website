          <p style="background-color: bisque; border-radius: 10px;padding: 20px;">1. <strong>Protect with padding</strong>
            Everyone has been there; drops, bumps, and slips result in unsightly cosmetic dings that leave your computer
            looking less-than-loved. If youâ€™re like most people who travel with their PC, safeguarding against accidents
            can feel next to impossible when packing your PC away into a carry-on. An exposed laptop is vulnerable to
            all
            of the elements of travel you likely want to protect it from.
            Whether youâ€™re traveling business-class or to a classroom across campus, shielding your PC against the
            elements starts with a protective case. There are a few different styles of protection that offer differing
            levels of armor and functionality. These include:
            <strong>SKINS</strong>
            Functioning as a full-body laptop sticker, laptop skins are best for protecting the chassis from light
            damage
            and scratches.
            HARDSHELL SNAP-ON COVERS
            Polycarbonate, plastic, or rubberized hard shell laptop covers protect your PC while still granting easy
            access to ports, buttons, lights, and fans.
            <strong>SLEEVES</strong>
            A simple, soft, envelope-style pouch typically made of gentle materials like nylon, polyester, suede, or
            microfiber, laptop sleeves are lightweight protection.
            MESSENGER BAG
            A shoulder bag specifically designed to accommodate your laptop and necessary peripherals, the dedicated
            laptop messenger bag offers the most padded protection.<br><br><br>
            <strong>2. Organize cords</strong>
            The only thing more frustrating than dealing with long, confusing cables is getting them all mixed up and
            tangled in the process. Keeping your digital world connected is a must, so nixing the cables isnâ€™t a
            feasible
            option. Taking the time to declutter and organize the snake-like mass of wires spawning from your power
            strip
            and PC ports is a great first step for both desktop and laptop users.

            With our own scholarship program in Software development,at lira university, we have established a new area
            of
            #impact and, for the first time, implemented our own structures on-site in Kampala, Uganda.
            A lot has also happened with computer labs, and training facilities.
            Here are some of our highlights in numbers:<br>
            ðŸ”§Training facility workshops completed<br>
            ðŸš¨ Disaster relief projects supported i.e borehole in OMORO.
